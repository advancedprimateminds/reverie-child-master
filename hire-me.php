		<p>I’m currently available for web development and design projects. To request a quote, please include the following information about your website:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Are you looking for development, design or both?</li>
			<li>A list of each unique page template designs you’ll need. (“Unique” refers to the fact that you can re-use one template for an infinite number of pages, even though the content will be different across those pages. For example: a single blog post template.)</li>
			<li>Content requirements and any special functionality on each page (for example: e-commerce, slideshow, parallax, contact form, etc.).</li>
			<li>Will it need to be responsive? In other words, will the layout adapt to mobile devices like tablets and smart phones?</li>
			<li>Your budget.</li>
			<li>Your timeline.</li>

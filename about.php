		<h3>What Does It Mean To Be An Advanced Primate Mind? //<h3>
		<p>Advanced Primate Minds centers around the concept of evolution. In a world in constant flux it is grounding to recall humanity’s simple roots and equally astounding to retrace man's lineage back to our mysterious primordial beginnings. My personal fascination with history and anthropology has left me to muse over these subjects for perhaps much longer than any sane New Yorker should. But through my contemplations, I realized that it's not just about the past- we must use this identity to discover the future.</p>

		<h3>Coding The Future //</h3>
		<p>I apply this forward-looking approach to my code by creating responsive, mobile-first and feature-rich websites in the spirit of emulating the aesthetics of Advanced Primate Minds. Whether you are a Fortune 500 company or a small business, I want to create an easy to manage website designed to take your company to its next evolutionary level.</p>
